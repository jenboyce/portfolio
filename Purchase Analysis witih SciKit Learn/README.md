# Purchase Analysis with SciKit Learn

This study utilized a variety of knowledge discovery tools to better understand grocery marketing and customer behavior.

**Specifically, analysis focused on four questions:**
* Can customer demographics predict a customerâ€™s transaction amount?
* What items do customers frequently purchase together?
* How can customers be segmented by similar characteristics?
* Is it possible to predict which households will redeem coupons?

To answer these questions, regression analysis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, association rules mining, classification, and logistic regression were employed. 

**The findings of the report included the following:**
* Customer household income was the greatest predictor of the amount a customer spent in a single transaction, followed by the number of children in the household.
* White milk and chocolate milk are the items that customers most frequently purchase together.
* In segmenting customers by similar demographic characteristics for marketing purposes, customers are best characterized by their marital status and number of children, followed by income and age.
* Coupon redemption is most likely among higher-income customers ($125,000 - $175,000) and those who rent their homes.
