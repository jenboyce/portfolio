This repo contains examples of my data science work.

### Purchase Analysis with SciKit Learn
* **Challenge:** Can customer demographics predict transaction amounts? Which items do customers frequently purchase together? How can customers be segmented by similar characteristics? Is it possible to predict which households will redeem coupons? A variety of data mining techniques were employed to find the answers.
* **Techniques:** Multiple Regression, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Association Rules Mining (Frequent Itemset/Market Basket Analysis), Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees
* **Results:** Despite a very noisy data set, transaction amount was predicted with 63% accuracy, and coupon redemption was predicted with 60% accuracy. Market basket analysis identified 18 groups of products with high support and lift. Customer segmentation identified 5 distinct groups of customers appropriate for personalized marketing promotions.

### Chicago Crime Trends
* **Challenge:** By analyzing violent crime incidents from 2001 through 2015, this study developed a time series model to predict the incidence of violent crime in Chicago.
* **Techniques:** SARIMA models
* **Results:** The resulting model predicted daily crime rate with a 76% accuracy rate.
